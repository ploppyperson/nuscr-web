            <h2>The early years...</h2>

            <p>In late 1957, a number of students (inc. Roger Baldwin and John Underwood) came to study at the University
              of Nottingham who were already experienced bellringers. They attended the practice at Nottingham, St. Peter.
              The inaugural meeting was held on 29 January 1958 and the Nottingham University Society of Change Ringers
              (NUSCR) was formed.</p>

            <p>A separate practice night was held by the Society at St. Peter's between 1958 and 1960. In 1960, attempts
              were made to make the derelict bells at All Saints' ringable. This was only partially successful and the
              Society's practice night moved there from 1960-62. Due to the poor state of the bells, the Society then
              moved to Beeston where the bells required less work to make them ringable. During this period the Society
              did well. Local people (who were not students) were also taught to ring on the bells and this caused
              friction in the early 1970s. At an EGM on 17 March 1972 it was formally decided to leave Beeston and return
              to All Saints'.</p>

            <h2>Late 90's</h2>
              <p>Around 1995, a report gave the bells approximately 5 years before they would be unringable. Quotes were
                obtained to rehang the bells in a modern steel bellframe for ten bells (i.e. space for two extra treble
                bells in addition to the eight that were there). With some uncertainty the Society set out in 1996 to raise
                the initial quote of almost £12,000. A ring-a-thon was held, sponsored walks and various other
                fundraising activities. Surprisingly the money mounted up much more quickly than expected and discussion
                began to centre on whether it might be possible to augment the bells to ten also. This would require the
                original eight bells to be tuned (as they were cast in 1864 prior to modern bell tuning) at a further cost
                of £1800. In 1999, members of the Society helped to lower the eight bells out of the tower (the heaviest
                being 3/4 ton or 760 kg) and removed the old oak bellframe. Holes were then cut for the new steel frame and
                it was hoisted and bolted together. The old eight bells were tuned and returned for Easter 1999.</p>

              <p>At the same time as the rehanging of the 8 bells in 1999. The former All Saints’ School bell was hung. It
                had been saved from the scrap heap by Rev. Bernard Baines, the then Honorary President of the Society. This
                bell is affectionately known as Bernard’s Bell, and it is chimed in his memory prior to service on the
                nearest Sunday to his death (31 May 2007).</p>

            <p>In late 1999, quotes were obtained for two newly cast bells. It was decided to use Taylor's bells, these were
            cast in early 2004.</p>

          <h2>2019-2020 Restoration Project</h2>
          <p>The tenor was tested for the first time following restoration work on 23 January 2020; and on 8 February
            2020 the complete ring of 10 bells were first heard again during a test ring, rung by the volunteers with
            the top 10 most hours into the project. Then the bells were officially handed back to the society for
            ringing on 11 February 2020. On 7 March 2020, a band formed entirely of undergraduate students rang a
            quarter peal of "Plain Bob Caters" to celebrate their return to the tower. </p>
